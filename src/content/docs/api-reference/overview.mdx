#### Terms of Use

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Aside type="note" title="A Brief Statement on Rate Limits">
    We don't enforce a specific rate limit for requests made to our API, but simply ask that you be reasonable and polite. We will not limit your usage for normal website traffic, but we ask that you do not hammer our API with rapid requests made by an automated script. If you do, we will revoke your API access. If you have a use case that requires polling the API data for changes on a regular basis, or syncing large amounts of data at one time from the API to your system we require notifying us. We also have other technical solutions available that might better suit your needs. Please contact us and we can discuss technical solutions that are mutually satisfactory.
