### API Key

Getting your Authorized API Key
To get access to the Funnel listings API please contact your customer service representative. We will create a key for you on request, configured according to your needs.

Your customer service representative will discuss your intended API use to determine if you need a public or private access key. Typically public access keys are appropriate for website frontends and private access keys are required for server-to-server API integration.


### Basic Authentication

Requests are made using the HTTP Basic Authentication protocol. The username is your key and the password is blank. See the wikipedia page for more details: [HTTP Basic Auth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication#Client_side)

##### Example Usage

**Unix Shell**
```shell
curl --user <your_key>:  https://nestiolistings.com/api/v2/onlineleasing-link/
```

**Python**
```python
import requests

response = requests.get('https://nestiolistings.com/api/v2/onlineleasing-link/', auth=('<your_key>', ''))
```
