## What are Funnel Leasing Events

Funnel Leasing Events, or webhooks, are messages about an event that are sent via POST request from Funnel Leasing's servers to a user-defined callback url. They allow Funnel Leasing to automatically send real-time event data to your app when triggered by an event (like a unit being reserved). You can think of webhooks as push notifications for servers.

## How Events Are Sent

Events are transmitted as `application/json` POST requests, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of programming languages. Depending on your chosen language, you may need middleware tooling to effectively parse these requests and extract the relevant data. For a comprehensive understanding of handling Funnel Leasing Events, we recommend exploring our detailed [Events and Callbacks Walkthrough](/guides/events-and-callbacks/walkthrough). This resource offers invaluable insights into integrating event-driven functionalities seamlessly into your application architecture.
