The "Application Denied" event is a critical webhook triggered when an application is denied within Funnel Leasing. This event is essential for tracking and managing application statuses, providing necessary data for integrations to update records and take appropriate actions.

## Event Details

- **Event Type**: `application_denied`
- **Description**: This event is triggered when an application is denied, indicating that the applicant did not meet the required criteria.

By leveraging this event, integrations can streamline the denial process, ensure clear communication with applicants, and maintain data integrity within the Funnel Leasing ecosystem.
