The "Application Completed" event is a significant webhook triggered when an application process is completed within Funnel Leasing. This event is essential for tracking and managing application statuses, providing necessary data for integrations to update records and proceed with subsequent steps.

## Event Details

- **Event Type**: `application_completed`
- **Description**: This event is triggered when an application process is successfully completed, indicating that all required steps have been fulfilled.
- **Event Payload Example**:

## Use Cases

This event is crucial for integrations that need to track and manage the completion of application processes. For instance, a Property Management System (PMS) integration can utilize this event to:

- **Update Application Status**: Automatically update the status of the application to 'completed' within the system.

- **Data Synchronization**: Sync the completion data across multiple systems to maintain consistent and up-to-date records.
- **Notify Stakeholders**: Send notifications to relevant stakeholders, including leasing agents and property managers, about the completion.

By leveraging this event, integrations can streamline the completion process, improve communication with applicants and staff, and ensure data integrity within the Funnel Leasing ecosystem.
