The "Resident Moved In" event is a significant webhook triggered when a resident moves into a unit within Funnel Leasing. This event is essential for tracking and managing the move-in process, providing necessary data for integrations to update records and proceed with subsequent steps.

## Event Details

- **Event Type**: `resident_moved_in`
- **Description**: This event is triggered when a resident moves into a unit, indicating that the unit is now occupied.
- **Event Payload Example**:

  }
}
```

## Payload Fields

- **Notify Stakeholders**: Send notifications to relevant stakeholders, including property managers and maintenance staff, about the resident's move-in.
- **Data Synchronization**: Sync the move-in data across multiple systems to maintain consistent and up-to-date records.

By leveraging this event, integrations can streamline the move-in process, ensure accurate unit occupancy tracking, and maintain data integrity within the Funnel Leasing ecosystem.
