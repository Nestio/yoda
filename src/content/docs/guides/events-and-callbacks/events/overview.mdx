## Overview

Welcome to the documentation for Funnel Leasing's Event Object. Here, you'll learn how to seamlessly integrate event-driven functionality into your applications by listening to events generated within your Funnel Leasing account.

Funnel Leasing generates event data to keep you informed about activities related to your applications, residents, and units. These events are pivotal in maintaining the synchronicity between your systems and Funnel Leasing.

## How It Works

When an event occurs, such as the status change of an application from Submitted to being Approved by a Leasing Professional, Funnel Leasing creates a new Event object. This object encapsulates the pertinent details of the event, allowing you to react accordingly. For instance, upon receiving an `lease_transaction.status_updated` event, your system can automate actions like reserving a unit in your Property Management System (PMS).

## Listening to Events

By registering webhook endpoints in your Funnel Leasing account, you empower Funnel Leasing to automatically dispatch Event objects to these endpoints via POST requests whenever an event occurs. This enables your application to respond promptly and effectively.

## The Event Object

The Event object dispatched to your webhook endpoint provides a comprehensive snapshot of the changes that have taken place. Let's delve into its structure and contents.

### Example Event Payload

Here's an example of the payload you can expect to receive:

```json
{
  "id": 8932127,
  "event_type": "lease_transaction.status_updated",
  "event_timestamp": 1680064028,
  "idempotency_key": null,
  "event_data": {
      "lease_transaction_id": 74824,
      "lease_transaction_type": "Application",
      "current_status": "Approved",
      "previous_status": "Submitted",
      "client_id": 12453,
      "community_id": 43522
  },
}
```

### Event Object Structure

Let's break down the components of the Event object:

- **`id`**: This unique identifier facilitates easy referencing of events for communication with Funnel Leasing and troubleshooting purposes.

- **`event_type`**: Indicating the type of event that has occurred, this field enables your application to determine the necessary processing steps. The structure of the accompanying `event_data` object varies based on the event type.

- **`event_timestamp`**: This timestamp denotes the exact moment when Funnel Leasing triggered the event.

- **`event_data`**: Containing essential information about the event, this object provides context for your application to act upon. Its structure varies according to the specific event type.

## Next Steps

To explore the full spectrum of event types that Funnel Leasing sends to your webhook, refer to the [complete list of event types](/guides/events-and-callbacks/events/event-names). Understanding these events and their payloads will empower you to build robust integrations that leverage real-time data from Funnel Leasing.
