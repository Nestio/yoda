description: Learn how to integrate Funnel Leasing Events and Callbacks into your application.
---

This walkthrough provides comprehensive instructions for integrating Funnel Leasing Events and Callbacks (commonly known as "webhooks") into your application. These webhooks deliver event metadata automatically whenever an action occurs within the Funnel Online Leasing product.

This resource focuses on implementation details, offers examples, and guides you through the process of working with webhooks. For a broader understanding of Funnel Leasing Events, please consult the [Events Overview](/guides/events-and-callbacks/overview) section in our documentation.

### Setting Up Funnel Leasing Events

Enabling Funnel Leasing Events (webhooks) involves two main steps:

1. Setting the callback URL within Funnel Leasing, which we'll cover below.
2. Responding to events to confirm their reception.


#### Set a Callback Url

To configure the account callback URL, please contact the Funnel Leasing technical support team at [support@funnelleasing.com](mailto:support@funnelleasing.com). Alternatively, you can reach out to your assigned account representative for direct assistance.

#### Responding to Events

Funnel Leasing dispatches events to a specified callback URL and expects a specific response for verification purposes. Upon receiving an event, the callback URL must return an HTTP `200` response with a body containing the string `Funnel API Event Received`. Failure to respond triggers a retry mechanism by Funnel Leasing.

<Aside type="caution" title="FAILED CALLBACKS">
    Too many consecutive failed callbacks will result in Funnel Leasing deactivating webhooks for a callback url. Once deactivated, Funnel Leasing will stop sending events until a new callback url is added. Read more about this behavior in the Failures and Retries section.
</Aside>

Here's a basic example in NodeJS:
```js
// This sample is stripped down
// Use for reference only
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.post('/funnel-events', (req, res) => {
    res.set('content-Type', 'text/plain');
    res.status(200).send('Funnel API Event Received`');
});
```

#### Testing your Callback Url

During the setup process, you can test your callback URL's functionality by triggering a test event through the Funnel Leasing testing API. This ensures that your webhook handler responds correctly to events.

### Securing your Callback Handler
Make sure that webhook events are originating from Funnel Leasing by using the following recommended method.

#### IP Address Whitelisting
We have made a JSON file containing the full list of IP addresses that webhook events may come from available for you below.

```json
{
    "updatedDate": "2024-06-06-20-11-43",
    "ips": {
        "us": [
            "**.**.**.**/32",
            "**.**.**.**/32",
        ]
    }
}

```

Note: This list will be automatically updated if the IP addresses change. We recommend checking this list periodically to ensure your callback handler is secure.

### Failures and Retries

If your callback url is not reachable or returns a non-successful response, we will retry POSTing the event up to **6 times**, with each retry interval being longer than the previous one. If the **sixth retry fails**, you will begin receiving notifications by email.

After **10 consecutive failures**, your callback URL will be automatically cleared.

Please note that our requests will timeout after **20 seconds**, so callbacks will fail if your server takes longer than that to respond. The retry pattern is described below.

| Retry  | Delay After Previous Attempt |
|--------|------------------------------|
| First  | 5 minutes                    |
| Second | 15 minutes                   |
| Third  | 45 minutes                   |
| Fourth | 2 hours 15 minutes           |
| Fifth  | 6 hours 45 minutes           |
| Sixth  | 20 hours 15 minutes          |

The above retry pattern may not always be exact, but it is a good approximation of the retry pattern we use.
